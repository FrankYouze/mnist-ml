# Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST and TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple neural network model to recognize handwritten digits using the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The model is implemented in TensorFlow, trained on the MNIST dataset, and can classify images of digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy.

> **Note**: This project was prepared as part of a YIT Community Simple Challenge.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a basic neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras, designed to classify handwritten digits. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow

- NumPy


You can install these packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
